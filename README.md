# 🔋 Energy Efficient CPU Scheduling  
A JavaScript-based implementation of an energy-efficient CPU scheduling system using **Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)** and **Priority Scheduling** to minimize CPU power consumption while maintaining performance.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates how an operating system can optimize CPU energy usage by dynamically adjusting CPU frequency based on system load.  
It calculates effective burst times, schedules processes by priority, estimates energy consumption, and renders visual outputs.
